'''
In this exercise you'll work with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. 
You'll predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on two features: 
  - the mean radius of the tumor (radius_mean)
  - its mean number of concave points (concave points_mean).

The dataset is already loaded in your workspace and is split into 80% train and 20% test. 
The feature matrices are assigned to X_train and X_test, while the arrays of labels are assigned to y_train and y_test where class 1 corresponds to a malignant tumor and class 0 corresponds to a benign tumor. 
To obtain reproducible results, we also defined a variable called SEED which is set to 1.

# Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier 'dt' with a maximum depth of 6
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=6, random_state=SEED)

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)
print(y_pred[0:5])

'''
Now that you've fit your first classification tree, it's time to evaluate its performance on the test set. 
You'll do so using the accuracy metric which corresponds to the fraction of correct predictions made on the test set.

The trained model dt from the previous exercise is loaded in your workspace along with the test set features matrix X_test and the array of labels y_test.
'''
# Import accuracy_score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Predict test set labels
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

# Compute test set accuracy  
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Test set accuracy: {:.2f}".format(acc))

'''
A classification tree divides the feature space into rectangular regions. 
In contrast, a linear model such as logistic regression produces only a single linear decision boundary dividing the feature space into two decision regions.

We have written a custom function called plot_labeled_decision_regions() that you can use to plot the decision regions of a list containing two trained classifiers. 
You can type help(plot_labeled_decision_regions) in the IPython shell to learn more about this function.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, the model dt that you've trained in an earlier exercise, as well as the function plot_labeled_decision_regions() are available in your workspace.
'''
# Import LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model
from sklearn.linear_model import  LogisticRegression

# Instatiate logreg
logreg = LogisticRegression(random_state=1)

# Fit logreg to the training set
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Define a list called clfs containing the two classifiers logreg and dt
clfs = [logreg, dt]

# Review the decision regions of the two classifiers
plot_labeled_decision_regions(X_test, y_test, clfs)

'''
In this exercise, you'll train a classification tree on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset using entropy as an information criterion. 
You'll do so using all the 30 features in the dataset, which is split into 80% train and 20% test.

X_train as well as the array of labels y_train are available in your workspace.
'''
# Import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Instantiate dt_entropy, set 'entropy' as the information criterion
dt_entropy = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy', max_depth=8, random_state=1)

# Fit dt_entropy to the training set
dt_entropy.fit(X_train, y_train)

'''
In this exercise you'll compare the test set accuracy of dt_entropy to the accuracy of another tree named dt_gini. 
The tree dt_gini was trained on the same dataset using the same parameters except for the information criterion which was set to the gini index using the keyword 'gini'.

X_test, y_test, dt_entropy, as well as accuracy_gini which corresponds to the test set accuracy achieved by dt_gini are available in your workspace.
'''
# Import accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Use dt_entropy to predict test set labels
y_pred= dt_entropy.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy_entropy
accuracy_entropy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print accuracy_entropy
print(f'Accuracy achieved by using entropy: {accuracy_entropy:.3f}')

# Print accuracy_gini
print(f'Accuracy achieved by using the gini index: {accuracy_gini:.3f}')

'''
In this exercise, you'll train a regression tree to predict the mpg (miles per gallon) consumption of cars in the auto-mpg dataset using all the six available features.

The dataset is processed for you and is split to 80% train and 20% test. 
The features matrix X_train and the array y_train are available in your workspace.
'''
# Import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=8,
            min_samples_leaf=0.13,
            random_state=3)

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

'''
In this exercise, you will evaluate the test set performance of dt using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. 
The RMSE of a model measures, on average, how much the model's predictions differ from the actual labels. 
The RMSE of a model can be obtained by computing the square root of the model's Mean Squared Error (MSE).

The features matrix X_test, the array y_test, as well as the decision tree regressor dt that you trained in the previous exercise are available in your workspace.
'''
# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Compute y_pred
y_pred = dt.predict(X_test)

# Compute mse_dt
mse_dt = MSE(y_test, y_pred)

# Compute rmse_dt
rmse_dt = mse_dt**(1/2)

# Print rmse_dt
print("Test set RMSE of dt: {:.2f}".format(rmse_dt))

'''
In this exercise, you'll compare the test set RMSE of dt to that achieved by a linear regression model. 
We have already instantiated a linear regression model lr and trained it on the same dataset as dt.

The features matrix X_test, the array of labels y_test, the trained linear regression model lr, mean_squared_error function which was imported under the alias MSE and rmse_dt from the previous exercise are available in your workspace.
'''
# Predict test set labels 
y_pred_lr = lr.predict(X_test)

# Compute mse_lr
mse_lr = MSE(y_test, y_pred_lr)

# Compute rmse_lr
rmse_lr = mse_lr**(1/2)

# Print rmse_lr
print('Linear Regression test set RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_lr))

# Print rmse_dt
print('Regression Tree test set RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(rmse_dt))
