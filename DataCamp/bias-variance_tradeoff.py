In the following set of exercises, you'll diagnose the bias and variance problems of a regression tree. 
The regression tree you'll define in this exercise will be used to predict the mpg consumption of cars from the auto dataset using all available features.

We have already processed the data and loaded the features matrix X and the array y in your workspace. 
In addition, the DecisionTreeRegressor class was imported from sklearn.tree.
'''
# Import train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Set SEED for reproducibility
SEED = 1

# Split the data into 70% train and 30% test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.3, random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate a DecisionTreeRegressor dt
dt = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=4, min_samples_leaf=0.26, random_state=SEED)


'''
In this exercise, you'll evaluate the 10-fold CV Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in the previous exercise.

In addition to dt, the training data including X_train and y_train are available in your workspace. 
We also imported cross_val_score from sklearn.model_selection.

Note that since cross_val_score has only the option of evaluating the negative MSEs, its output should be multiplied by negative one to obtain the MSEs. 
The CV RMSE can then be obtained by computing the square root of the average MSE.
'''
# Compute the array containing the 10-folds CV MSEs
MSE_CV_scores = - cross_val_score(dt, X_train, y_train, cv=10, 
                       scoring='neg_mean_squared_error',
                       n_jobs=-1)

# Compute the 10-folds CV RMSE
RMSE_CV = (MSE_CV_scores.mean())**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_CV
print('CV RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_CV))


'''
You'll now evaluate the training set RMSE achieved by the regression tree dt that you instantiated in a previous exercise.

In addition to dt, X_train and y_train are available in your workspace.

Note that in scikit-learn, the MSE of a model can be computed as follows:
MSE_model = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_predicted)
where we use the function mean_squared_error from the metrics module and pass it the true labels y_true as a first argument, and the predicted labels from the model y_predicted as a second argument.
'''
# Import mean_squared_error from sklearn.metrics as MSE
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error as MSE

# Fit dt to the training set
dt.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels of the training set
y_pred_train = dt.predict(X_train)

# Evaluate the training set RMSE of dt
RMSE_train = (MSE(y_train, y_pred_train))**(1/2)

# Print RMSE_train
print('Train RMSE: {:.2f}'.format(RMSE_train))


'''
In the following set of exercises, you'll work with the Indian Liver Patient Dataset from the UCI Machine learning repository.

In this exercise, you'll instantiate three classifiers to predict whether a patient suffers from a liver disease using all the features present in the dataset.

The classes LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier under the alias KNN are available in your workspace.
'''
# Set seed for reproducibility
SEED=1

# Instantiate lr
lr = LogisticRegression(random_state=SEED)

# Instantiate knn
knn = KNN(n_neighbors=27)

# Instantiate dt
dt = DecisionTreeClassifier(min_samples_leaf=0.13, random_state=SEED)

# Define the list classifiers
classifiers = [('Logistic Regression', lr), ('K Nearest Neighbours', knn), ('Classification Tree', dt)]


'''
In this exercise you'll evaluate the performance of the models in the list classifiers that we defined in the previous exercise. 
You'll do so by fitting each classifier on the training set and evaluating its test set accuracy.

The dataset is already loaded and preprocessed for you (numerical features are standardized) and it is split into 70% train and 30% test. 
The features matrices X_train and X_test, as well as the arrays of labels y_train and y_test are available in your workspace. 
In addition, we have loaded the list classifiers from the previous exercise, as well as the function accuracy_score() from sklearn.metrics.
'''
# Iterate over the pre-defined list of classifiers
for clf_name, clf in classifiers:    
 
    # Fit clf to the training set
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)    
   
    # Predict y_pred
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred) 
   
    # Evaluate clf's accuracy on the test set
    print('{:s} : {:.3f}'.format(clf_name, accuracy))
    
    
'''
Finally, you'll evaluate the performance of a voting classifier that takes the outputs of the models defined in the list classifiers and assigns labels by majority voting.

X_train, X_test,y_train, y_test, the list classifiers defined in a previous exercise, as well as the function accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics are available in your workspace.
'''
# Import VotingClassifier from sklearn.ensemble
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingClassifier

# Instantiate a VotingClassifier vc
vc = VotingClassifier(estimators=classifiers)     

# Fit vc to the training set
vc.fit(X_train, y_train)   

# Evaluate the test set predictions
y_pred = vc.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print('Voting Classifier: {:.3f}'.format(accuracy))
